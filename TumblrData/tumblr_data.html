	<div class="container-fluid" id="mainstuff">

	<div class="jumbotron">
		<h1>Tumblr For Data Nerds</h1>
		<p>PSA: this site is unfinished and all graphs are currently using dummy data. I'm making a mildly-functional prototype as a proof of concept.</p>
		<p>Once this is finished, this will be a site where Tumblr users can track their activity, tag usage, and more.</p>
	</div>

	<table class="table table-hover">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Ultimate Blog Stats</h1>
				<p>This will contain a little bit of all the one-user stats. Includes easily accesible stuff like followers, likes, but also less common stuff like average note count, percentage of original content.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Tag Tracker</h1>
				<p>Some kind of tag cloud thing, line graph of top tags, ability to track just one tag, bar chart of tag usage, popular posts with that tag, posts that have been reblogged more than once, stuff like that.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Blog Tag Comparison</h1>
				<p>This will compare percentage of tags on x person's blog to y person's blog.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Usage Analysis</h1>
				<p>This will show a line graph of how many posts u have posted.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Tumblr Friendship</h1>
				<p>This is going to be similar to the Facebook Friendship review thing. It will show how much two users have reblogged from one another, what they have tagged one another in, etc.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Tag Association</h1>
				<p>Given tag X, what tags A,B,C are most commonly associated with it?</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h1>Audio Post Stuff</h1>
				<p>Analyzes audio posts. What artists are most represented? What years are these songs from? Might connect to last.fm API too in order to get information.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
