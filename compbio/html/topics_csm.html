<h3>Cellular and Systems Modelling</h3>
<h4>What is Cellular and Systems Modeling?</h4>
<p>A system is a collection of items that interact with one another. In biology, this can take many forms, from a cell (whose organelles interact with one another) to an entire ecosystems (where individual orgnaisms interact with one another). Often, it is difficult to perturb these real-life systems, so this is where creating a model can be useful. Models of ecosystems can predict how species respond to changes in their environment, while models of systems within the body can predict how a person may react to a given medical drug.</p>
<p>Biological systems can be represented in a variety of ways. Some can be modelled with a system of differential equations; this is commonly used when trying to model ecological systems. Systems can also be modelled as a mathematical graph, with nodes representing the items in the system (for example, the organelles in a cell) and edges between nodes representing how those items interact (for example, what and how much of a certain thing is passed between the organelles).</p>

<p><blockquote>This paper investigates the use of metabolic networks in predicting what side effects a given drug will produce. The authors used publically available data from <a href="http://sideeffects.embl.de/">SIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/">DrugBank</a> to create Support Vector Machines that predict side effects.</blockquote></p>
