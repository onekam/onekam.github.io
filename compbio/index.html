	      <h3>What is Computational Biology?</h3>
	      <p>Computational Biology is exactly what it sounds like: a field where computational methods are applied to solve problems in biology. Computational Biologists seek to solve biological problems that usually cannot be solved (at least not efficiently) by human hands alone, yet require more biological knowledge than a pure computer scientist would know or want to learn. </p>
	      <p>Whereas biologists may perform experiments <i>in vivo</i> or <i>in situ</i>, a computational biologist does most of their work <i>in silico</i>, referring to the silicon of a computer chip. As can be seen by the various Research pages on this website, this can entail many different things, from sequencing and performing data analytics on a genome to modelling systems within the body.</p>
	      <p>One may also hear of the term <i>bioinformatics</i> when reading about computational biology. While the NIH, among other organizations, have sought to provide disjoint definitions of computational biology vs. bioinformatics, these definitions are not widely adopted, and the line between what makes someone a "computational biologist" versus a "bioinformatician" is murky. Thus, it would be reasonable to consider the two essentially the same field.</p>

	      <h3>Cellular and Systems Modelling</h3>
	      <h4>What is Cellular and Systems Modeling?</h4>
	      <p>A system is a collection of items that interact with one another. In biology, this can take many forms, from a cell (whose organelles interact with one another) to an entire ecosystems (where individual orgnaisms interact with one another). Often, it is difficult to perturb these real-life systems, so this is where creating a model can be useful. Models of ecosystems can predict how species respond to changes in their environment, while models of systems within the body can predict how a person may react to a given medical drug.</p>
	      <p>Biological systems can be represented in a variety of ways. Some can be modelled with a system of differential equations; this is commonly used when trying to model ecological systems. Systems can also be modelled as a mathematical graph, with nodes representing the items in the system (for example, the organelles in a cell) and edges between nodes representing how those items interact (for example, what and how much of a certain thing is passed between the organelles).</p>

	      <p><blockquote>This paper investigates the use of metabolic networks in predicting what side effects a given drug will produce. The authors used publically available data from <a href="http://sideeffects.embl.de/">SIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/">DrugBank</a> to create Support Vector Machines that predict side effects.</blockquote></p>

	      <h3>Clinical Medicine</h3>
	      <p>With the rise of machine learning methods such as deep learning, many researchers with interest in human health and wellness have turned to computation. Applications to clinical medicine are most often geared toward this idea of personalized medicine: creating a custom means of treatment for an individual based on their personal profile.</p>

	    	<h3>Information Retrieval</h3>
	    	<p>Information Retrieval is an interesting area of research in data mining and is applicable in many fields, from English literature to chemistry, and of course including biology.</p>
	    	<p>Biology has a wealth of information available, from protein databases to human medical records.</p>

	    <!-- Image Processing -->

	  		</figure>
	    	<h3>Image Processing</h3>
	    	<p>The stereotypical image of a biologist is often portrayed as a person in a white coat staring into a microscope. Many scientists spend hours doing this, manually classifying slides. Image processing seeks to reduce and eventually perhaps eliminate this aspect of biology, instead turning to computational methods to manually analyze visual data, including cell slides.</p>

	  		</figure>
	    	<h3>Phylogenetics</h3>
    		<p> Phylogeny conveys evolutionary relationships between two things. A phylogenetic tree often displays relationships between organisms, showing which species evolved from one another, helping to decipher common ancestors and genetic lineage. </p>
    		<!-- TODO: find a paper that does this for like species -->
    		<!-- TODO: discuss difference between phylogeny and phylogenetics -->
    		<p> Phylogeny does not just have to pertain to whole species, however. Researchers often use phylogenetic information to learn about pathogens, tumor cell lines, and more.</p>

	    <!-- Sequencing Data -->

	      <h3>Sequencing Data</h3>
	      <p>As sequencing technology becomes less expensive and thus more accessible, biologists find themselves with a wealth of information. Computational biologists who work with sequencing data can find themselves working on better algorithms for assembling genome data, finding transcription errors, and more.</p>

	    <!--- COURSEWORK: PREREQS -->
	    <div id="crs-prereqs" class="tab-pane fade">
	      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
	      <p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field, drawing people whose sole education is in biology, computer science, math, chemistry, and more. Thus, it is not uncommon for those interested in studying it to have deficiencies in one or more of the relevant areas, and to improve on these deficiencies while tacking their research projects.</p>
	      <p>However, for those who would like to receive a more formal introduction to the fields in which they are lacking, there exists <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003662">a really extensive guide</a> to courses to a Computational Biology curriculum. This guide by David Searls provides a list of pretty much any course one could think of relevant to a future in computational biology, from highly relevant courses in molecular biology to philosophy. The guide includes links to relevant MOOC's and other online resources, as well as lists some (usually low cost) books that could be useful in self-teaching the topics as well.</p>
	      <p>The above guide can seem a bit daunting. On this page, I'll provide my own analysis of what I, after some research into the topic, deem as essential to the computational biology experience.</p>
